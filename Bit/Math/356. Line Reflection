356. Line Reflection
Given n points on a 2D plane, find if there is such a line parallel to y-axis that reflect the given points.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],[-1,1]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: [[1,1],[-1,-1]]
Output: false
Follow up:
Could you do better than O(n2) ?

public:
    bool isReflected(vector<vector<int>>& points) {
        
    }
};
