### 307. Range Sum Query - Mutable
Method1:
```
1. Analysis
Typical segment tree: need to get familiar with this data structure;

2. Time/Space Complexity:
Time: 
query: O(logN)
update: O(logN)
init: O(N)

Space:
O(N)

3. Similar Problems:
```

Method2:
```
1. Analysis
PreSum method: more naive

2. Time/Space Complexity:
Time: 
query: O(1)
update: O(N)
init: O(N)

Space:
O(N)
