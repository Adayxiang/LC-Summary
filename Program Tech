1. unordered_set<T> could not be combined with STD, just focus on basic data structure; Try to use set to remove duplicate;
2. to_string() and stoi() could be used to transfer string and int. Watch out that the length of to_string() may not be 1.
3. Comparator:
struct OrderByAge
{
    bool operator() (Human const &a, Human const &b) { return a.age < b.age; }
};
typedef std::priority_queue<Human, std::vector<Human>, OrderByAge> age_queue;
