###Method 1: dfs
```
1. Analysis
A typycal dfs problem. Everytime we search a point, we search adjacent part;

2. Time/Space Complexity:
Space: O(m * n)
Time: O(1)

###Method 2: Union
```
1. Analysis
We consider union to solve this question. Everytime we get a '1', we union it with  adjacent part.

2. Time/Space Complexity:
Space: O(m * n)
Time: O(m * n)
