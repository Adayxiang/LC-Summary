Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node p is the node with the smallest key greater than p.val.

You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node.

class Solution {
public:
    Node* inorderSuccessor(Node* node) {
        if(!node) return node;
        Node* res = NULL;
        if(node->right)
        {
            node = node->right;
            while(node && node->left)
            {
                node = node->left;
            }
            return node;
        }
        else
        {
            while(node && node->parent && node->parent->right == node)
            {
                node = node->parent;
            }
            return node->parent;
        }
    }
};
